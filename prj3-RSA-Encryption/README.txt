Almost all algorithms that check for primality have a common concept
(this is what we used in our program):
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/627463/how-can-i-test-for-primality

If the user chooses to let the program choose prime numbers, the default location will be in the working directory of the program. The default file name will be "prime_numbers.rsc". However, the user can browse through their machine to specify a different file that can exist in any other directory via the JFileChooser component. The only restriction is that it must be of .rsc type, as the JFileChooser will filter through only .rsc files (this was a suggestion from the project writeup).
